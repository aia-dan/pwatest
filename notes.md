## Behavior Notes

### 20221005

The website works offline for the most part. Currently, the "offline" mode is mostly functional on the main page, has the carrocel, but none of the images are there, and "offline.html" doesn't get navigated to (this was anticipated, as there is not literal or direct navigation patterns the user has to get to the page. However, it also does not have a rollover function by default).
